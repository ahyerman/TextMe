# TextMe
A python script leveraging twilio and doublemap API

It's a work in progress right now but ideally will send a text
alert regarding bus arrivals at configured times.

Eventually might try to add text feature for set up, text feature
for special stop requests.

Note: This repo does not contain config.py. In order to run the script you will
need to create config.py in the working directory and put the variables account_sid and auth_token
